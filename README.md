# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Project 04 : Analyze A/B Test Results of an E-Commerce website
## Introduction
In this project, we are going to analyze the results of an A/B test by an E-commerce company by going through three main sections as below:
### Part 1: Probability
- Perform data cleaning on our dataset.
- Extract some statistics from the cleaned dataset to gain an overall picture on the test result.
### Part 2: A/B Test
- Use hypothesis testing to validate our assumption regarding conversion rate of two landing pages.
- Utilize another method with statsmodels library and compare the result to our previous findings to see if there are any discrepancies.
### Part 3: A regression approach
- Perform logistics regression and then analyze our hypotheses and outputs, especially with regard to our conclusion in Part 2.
- Provide further analysis by adding more variables to our model while taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of this decision.
